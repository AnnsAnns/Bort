# Collaboration

As with the original blog, this repository, *compared to other repositories of mine*, isn't meant to be welcoming to contributions from other developers given the nature of a *personal* blog, it is however open source with the goal of freedom of knowledge for people to use when interested in the behind the scene magic of the site and I do welcome people finding spelling mistakes, etc.
