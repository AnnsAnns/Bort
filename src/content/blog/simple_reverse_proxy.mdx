This is technically a sequel to [Minecraft SRV Record Magic](/blog/minecraft_use_custom_domains/),
which is a bonus to [How to host a Minecraft server, sustainably, locally, and securely](/blog/sustainable_minecraft/),
which is a sequel to [IPv6, Germany and Tunnels](/blog/ipv6_germany_tunnels/).

As with every year for the last decade, some friends and I are having the yearly Minecraft winter project.

## A timeline

Lets quickly talk about a rough timeline of how we played Minecraft in the past, this is a personal blog afterall.
It would be boring to directly skip to [The Reverse Proxy Part](/blog/simple_reverse_proxy/#reverse-proxy).

### The Beginnings

Over the years the way I have hosted this server has changed drastically.
It all started with a simple hamachi setup. 
Thanks to have fundementally broken IPv4 is on the modern web, we didn't understand NAT,
nor how to forward ports, it was also complicated and confusing.

Back then nearly everyone had Hamachi installed, from Minecraft to Terraria, if you were playing
a game back then, you were pretty much bound to use hamachi.

Later, after finding out how paysafecards work, we rented small servers, think of Nitrado [^3] or other
insanely expensive Minecraft server hosts. They honestly served their function well, as with most
Minecraft projects it would usually die after the holy _2 Week Minecraft Phase_, thus we usually
only paid a few bucks. Nonetheless, a few bucks can be a gigantic amount of money, esp. for children.

### Aternos

At some point Aternos [^1] servers were becoming fairly usable. Aternos provided free servers financed
through website ad-revenue. Given that a simple VPS can be fairly affordable, that would seem like a fairly
niche business model, however, esp. for children this provides one of the very few safe and trusted ways to
easily play Minecraft together.

Nowadays Aternos even provides a paid service called Exaroton [^2], which basically just provides a supercharged Aternos
experience to you. However, one notable downside that Aternos had was the fact that A. you had to wait in a queue to start
your server and B. somebody had to be on the server for it to keep running. Honestly considering that this service is totally
free those stipulations were quite fair, however, as we became older, esp. stipulation B started become annoying,
in the teens sleep schedules and free time started to drift more and more apart, until we finally made the switch to actual
servers again.

### Minecraft VPS'

While money was still a problem, considering we were still children, we started finally buying servers again, this time from cheaper Minecraft VPS' hosts.
Nitrado [^3] usually offered a far better UX, however, it's not like it's rocket science to start a Minecraft server.

One of the longest lasting providers since we moved to using VPS' is probably ExtraVM [^4]. At first their UI was a bit rough, but as a kid your
most important decision factor was the price and esp. nowadays I feel like their prices were always super fair.

However, as I grew older and actually started understand what the heck a NAT even is, hosting stuff locally started becoming both feasible
and also interesting, mostly as a challenge, esp. considering that every blog post over the last (nearly) 2 years was about the pitfalls
and annoyances that come from it.

### Hosting Locally

Most of it is honestly explored in fairly great length in both [IPv6, Germany & Tunnels](/blog/ipv6_germany_tunnels/) and esp. [Hosting a Minecraft server sustainably](/blog/sustainable_minecraft/).

The TLDR of that is that Germany provides a unique challenge for self-hosting nowadays. My ISP does have IPv6 support, which is great, but a lot of my friends don't have IPv6 support. But I also can't really use
IPv4 because NAT is unforgiving and even more importantly, because I quite literally can't even really open ports anymore. My IPv4 is shared with countless other customers and also changes every X hours.

My past solution to this was to simply use a combination of Playit [^6] (See [The Playit section](/blog/sustainable_minecraft/#2-playit)) for game TCP/UDP traffic,
esp. for Minecraft, and Cloudflare Tunnels for web stuff.

This still works, *for the most part*. In the most recent winter project, we wanted to include Minecraft Bedrock players on the server.

Generally, Playit [^6] does support this usecase, with the tradeoffs mentioned within that blog article.
However, this year, for a reason I'm still not properly sure about, Playit kept breaking the port.
First users could connect but then after some time both the Bedrock and Voice Chat ports would completely block up, not responding to any requests anymore.

## Reverse Proxy

I honestly don't feel like using a free and "hacky" solution for so long was the wrong way to approach this but with this bug happening at the beginning of the only time my server ever gets traffic (Alias the big Minecraft project), settling with some weird solution to this problem felt wrong. What both Cloudflare and Playit offer are effectively limited and very specific solutions to Reverse Proxies.
Both route local data through a tunnel, thus, the logical next step was to finally do it myself to get rid of the limitations and take control of the stack.

### Finding the right server for the job

There are three important factors to consider here:

1. The server should be in Germany / EU
  - both for digital sovereignty and because anything else would cause lag on game servers
2. The server should be really really cheap
  - I don't need an actual beefy VPS, I need an exit node to my cheap local homeserver with fairly minimal web traffic
3. The server needs to have a fully dedicated IPv4
  - I'm not about to settle with another hack, if I commit to it I want to do it right,
