I use these in nearly all my projects, so I thought it might make sense to share them so I can just link to this page instead of copy-pasting them all the time. 
Please note that these are not meant to be used as-is, but rather as a starting point for your own CI workflows.

I guarantee that they work for me, but I can't guarantee that they will work for you, so please use them at your own risk.

Without further ado, here are the snippets:
## Test Rust with Clippy
Runs `cargo clippy` on push to `main` or on pull request to `main`.
```yaml
name: Rust

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

env:
  CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      with:
          components: clippy
    - run: cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

## Compile LaTeX to PDF
Compiles a LaTeX document to PDF and uploads it as an artifact.
```yaml
name: NAME Compile Action

# Only on push to dev with changes to the following files
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - dev
    paths:
      - 'docs/NAME/**'
      - '.github/workflows/NAME.yml'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Set up Git repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Compile LaTeX document
        uses: xu-cheng/latex-action@v3
        with:
          working_directory: docs/NAME/
          root_file: NAME.tex
      - name: Upload PDF file
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3

          # Remove previous build files
          clean: true
          # Do not remove the `.nojekyll` file: we have manually added an empty `.nojekyll` file
          # at the root of the `gh-pages` branch and
          # we don't want having to re-create it after each build.
