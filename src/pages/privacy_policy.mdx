# Privacy Policy


## General information and mandatory information

The website operator does not process personal data
beyond the purposes specified in these sections of this privacy policy.

Nevertheless, you have the right to obtain information about your data stored by us at any time
by contacting us via email.

### SSL or TLS encryption

For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content that you send to us as the website operator, our website uses SSL or TLS encryption. This means that data you transmit via this website cannot be read by third parties. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the “https://” address line of your browser and the lock symbol in the browser line.


## Hosting

Our host collects the following data transmitted by your browser in so-called log files:

IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referrer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, amount of data transferred, website from which the request originates, and information about the browser and operating system.

This is necessary to display our website and to ensure stability and security. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

There is no tracking and we have no direct access to this data, but only receive an anonymized statistical summary. This includes the address of the previously visited page, the frequency of the pages accessed and the number of unique visitors. We do not combine this data with other data.

We use the following host to provide our website:

GitHub Inc.
88 Colin P Kelly Jr St
San Francisco, CA 94107
United States

This is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, as we do not have to maintain a server on our premises. The server is located in the USA.

Further information on options for objecting to and removing data from GitHub can be found at: [https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages)

You have the right to object to the processing. Whether the objection is successful must be determined by weighing up the interests involved.

The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing no longer applies.

The processing of the data specified in this section is neither required by law nor contractually required. The functionality of the website cannot be guaranteed without processing.

GitHub has implemented compliance measures for international data transfers. These apply to all global activities in which GitHub processes personal data of natural persons in the EU. These measures are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). For more information, see: [https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-data-protection-addendum#attachment-1--the-standard-contractual-clauses-processors](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-data-protection-addendum#attachment-1--the-standard-contractual-clauses-processors)


## Cloudflare

We use the Content Delivery Network (CDN) from Cloudflare Germany GmbH, Rosental 7, c/o Mindspace, 80331 Munich, Germany (Cloudflare) to increase the security and delivery speed of our website. This is in line with our legitimate interest (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). A CDN is a network of servers distributed [worldwide] that is capable of delivering optimized content to website users. For this purpose, personal data may be processed in Cloudflare's server log files. Please refer to the information under “Hosting.”

Cloudflare is the recipient of your personal data and acts as a processor for us. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR in not operating a content delivery network ourselves.

You have the right to object to the processing. Whether the objection is successful must be determined by weighing up the interests involved.

The processing of the data specified in this section is neither required by law nor contractually stipulated. The functionality of the website cannot be guaranteed without the processing.

Your personal data will be stored by Cloudflare for as long as necessary for the purposes described.

We intend to transfer personal data to third countries outside the European Economic Area, in particular the USA.
